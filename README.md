# Julia set

## Overview

Computation is done on the CPU, uses multithreading. Use the mouse to move around and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Offers two views:

- number of iterations determines the color

- number of iterations determines the brightness

The second mode also allows you to adjust the hue, brightness and black threshold.
